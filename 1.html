        <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for penalising the countries supporting terrorism as part of their foreign policy by providing political, ideological, and financial support to the terror groups in an indirect reference to Pakistan. He said India is helping build momentum against terror funding while underlining the need for isolating organisations and individuals creating sympathy for terrorists.</p>
